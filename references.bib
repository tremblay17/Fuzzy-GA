  abstract = {The world receives more than 200 thousand people in a day and it is expected that the total world population will reach 9.6 billion by the year 2050. This will result in extra food demand, which can only be met from enhanced crop yield. Therefore, modernization of the agricultural sector becomes the need of the hour. There are many constraints that are responsible for the low production of crops, which can be overcome by using drone technology in the agriculture sector. This paper presents an analysis of drone technologies and their modifications with time in the agriculture sector in the last decade. The application of drones in the area of crop monitoring, and pesticide spraying for Precision Agriculture (PA) has been covered. The work done related to drone structure, multiple sensor development, innovation in spot area spraying has been presented. Moreover, the use of Artificial Intelligent (AI) and deep learning for the remote monitoring of crops has been discussed.}
